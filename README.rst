Flask-Sandboy
=============

|Build Status| |Coverage Status| |Downloads| |Latest Version|

Flask-Sandboy is `sandman's <http://www.github.com/jeffknupp/sandman>`__
litte brother. Like ``sandman``, Flask-Sandboy automatically generates
REST APIs. Unlike ``sandman``, it does so from existing Flask-SQLAlchemy
models.

**tl;dr Flask-Sandboy gives your models a RESTful HTTP endpoint
automagically, with proper support for all HTTP methods. It takes two
lines of code to use and has no dependencies.**

Installation
------------

Flask-Sandboy should be installed using ``pip``:

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install flask-sandboy

Usage
-----

Here is an example ``runserver.py`` for an existing Flask app with
Flask-SQLAlchemy models:

.. code:: python

    from flask import Flask
    from models import Machine, Cloud, db

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///db.sqlite3'
    db.init_app(app)
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()
    app.run(debug=True)

And here is that same app with RESTful endpoints automatically created
and managed by Flask-Sandboy

.. code:: python

    from flask import Flask
    from flask.ext.sandboy import Sandboy

    from models import Machine, Cloud, db

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///db.sqlite3'
    db.init_app(app)
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()
    sandboy = Sandboy(app, db, [Cloud, Machine])
    app.run(debug=True)

The only thing you need to do is instantiate the ``Sandboy`` class with
your app, your Flask-SQLAlchemy object (typically named ``db``), and a
list of Model classes for which you want REST endpoints created.

Start the server and let's test out our new REST API:

.. code:: shell

    $ http -vv -j POST localhost:5000/cloud name=first_cloud description="my first cloud"                                                                      master
    POST /cloud HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, compress
    Content-Length: 56
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Host: localhost:5000
    User-Agent: HTTPie/0.8.0

    {
        "description": "my first cloud",
        "name": "first_cloud"
    }

    HTTP/1.0 201 CREATED
    Content-Length: 75
    Content-Type: application/json
    Date: Tue, 06 May 2014 13:57:52 GMT
    Server: Werkzeug/0.9.4 Python/2.7.6

    {
        "description": "my first cloud",
        "id": 1,
        "name": "first_cloud"
    }

.. code:: shell

    $ http localhost:5000/cloud/1                                                                                                                                       master
    HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    Content-Length: 75
    Content-Type: application/json
    Date: Tue, 06 May 2014 13:53:18 GMT
    Server: Werkzeug/0.9.4 Python/2.7.6

    {
        "description": "my first cloud",
        "id": 1,
        "name": "first_cloud"
    }

.. code:: shell

    $ http DELETE :5000/cloud/1                                                                                                                                master
    HTTP/1.0 204 NO CONTENT
    Content-Length: 0
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    Date: Tue, 06 May 2014 13:53:23 GMT
    Server: Werkzeug/0.9.4 Python/2.7.6

All common HTTP methods are implemented (``HEAD``, ``OPTIONS``, ``GET``,
``DELETE``, ``POST``, ``PATCH``, ``PUT``) with proper HTTP status codes.

Validating Requests
-------------------

Flask-Sandboy comes with built-in request validation, ensuring that all
fields necessary to save the object to the database are present. Here's
what happens when we forget to include a field:

.. code:: shell

    $ http -j POST :5000/cloud name="bad cloud"                                                                                                          develop
    HTTP/1.0 403 FORBIDDEN
    Content-Length: 45
    Content-Type: application/json
    Date: Tue, 06 May 2014 14:05:52 GMT
    Server: Werkzeug/0.9.4 Python/2.7.6

    {
        "message": "cloud.description required"
    }

Pagination
----------

Flask-Sandboy supports pagination of results by default. Simply add a
``<model_name>?page=2`` to your request to get paginated results. By
default, 20 results per page are returned.

TODO
----

I'll leave it up to the Issues tab to track this.
